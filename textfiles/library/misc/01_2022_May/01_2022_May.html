I'm Back Baby: The Bread Pirate's Summer Plans Blog
</h2>

<h3>Tuesday May 10th, 2022</h3>
<p>Hey there nerds! It's great to be back.</p>

<p>If couldn't already tell, I have been taking a break from YouTube. THREE MONTHS to be exact! During that time, I focused on my college work, made a video for a talent show, learned web designing, and caught up on some video games I <strong>really</strong> wanted to play...</p>

<p>And now I am back!</p>

<p>This summer, I will be making Zelda videos for YouTube full-time! However, they will be a little bit different than before.</p>

<p>Last summer, I started an experiment to see what would happen if I made SUPER short videos (about 1-2 minutes) instead of long videos. My hypothesis was that shorter videos would be easier to make and that people would binge several of them at a time. AND! If people binged a lot of videos, then it would generate more views. But, what really happened was this…</p>

<img class="square" src="images/graph.webp" alt="A graph of Youtube views for one of my short videos. The line goes flat after 2 weeks showing that it is not getting many views." 

title="Hello World! I'm so excited. This is the first time I have EVER created hover text and it feels AWESOME! 

Earlier this year, a video game was released called The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe and leading up to the launch of the game they created a bunch of blogs. Each blog had a dozen pictures or so, and all of them had hover text. It was the best! 

So now, I am following in their footsteps.

I am become death, maker of hover text!!! Muh ha ha ha!">

<p>&hellip;each of the videos underperformed! Not only that, but they stopped generating a meaningful amount of views after only two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>What the heck!</strong> That was exactly the opposite of what I was looking for!</p>
<p>Okay, so what am I supposed to do now?</p>
<p>I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I&rsquo;M GOING TO DO! I am going to go back to basics. This summer, I am going to make normal length videos (4-8 minutes).</p>
<p>Aside from that, do not worry. The channel will still cover Zelda Fun Facts and will continue to do so into the future.</p>
<p>On top of that, I want to experiment with skit videos. They might be inspired by a certain YouTuber named <em>Begula</em>&hellip;</p>

<img style="object-fit: cover; object-position: bottom right; height: 25rem; width: 30rem;" class="square" src="images/begula.webp" alt="picture of a cat smiling, which is the avatar of the YouTuber in question" title="Aww! How cute.

By the way, the Youtuber's name isn't actually BeGULA. It is BeLUGA. The reason I spelt it wrong is because it is a trope in all his videos that no one can spell his name.">
    
<p>Hopefully this answered most of your questions about the future of the channel. I will post more updates on the blog at least once every month.</p>
    
<p>Stay tuned, and until I see you next time; have fun storming the castle!</p>
