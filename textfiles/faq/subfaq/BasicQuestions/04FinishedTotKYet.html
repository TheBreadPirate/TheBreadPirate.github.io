<h4>Where did the name The Bread Pirate come from?</h4>

<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> It&rsquo;s a reference to the &ldquo;The Dread Pirate Roberts&rdquo; from The Princess Bride.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Answer:</strong> I earned the title for my exploits in the Spanish Main! I plundered so many grain shipments that they dubbed me The Bread Pirate. To this day, I wear it as a badge of honor.</p>

<p><strong>Real Answer:</strong> I became a huge fan of The Princess Bride after my mom forced me to watch it in 2015. From then on I was a Princess Bride apostle. I read the unabridged book twice (it was really hard to find a copy), watched all the behind the scenes footage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1irYUfb-E">made videos about it,</a> and became the biggest Princess Bride fan ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, now fast forward. Pretend we&rsquo;re doing that thing with the VHS Tape where it actually speeds up&hellip;</p>

<p>In June 2016, me and some friends created a new Terraria world with the intent of making a let's play series (Terraria is a side-scrolling video game and is similar to Minecraft.). We needed usernames and even though I already had a username (Major Burton Wester) I decided to use something different. I went with <em>The Dread Pirate</em> -- the name of the notorious pirate captain from The Princess Bride.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="blue"><em>Hey, you got the name wrong! It&rsquo;s supposed to be Bread, not Dread!&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>What the heck? How did you get into my FAQ?</p>

<p class="blue"><em>Oh, well you left the door unlocked so I thought I&rsquo;d walk in.</em></p>

<p>That was very rude of you. Knock next time.</p>

<p class="blue">Okay... sorry.</p>

<p>Anyways, I typed in the name <em>The Dread Pirate </em>and customized my character. But as I was customizing my character, I noticed a typo. I had used a B instead of a D in the word Dread!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, I accidentally created the name &ldquo;The Bread Pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="blue"><em>See! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you it was supposed to be Bread!</em></p>

<p>Yes. You&rsquo;re very smart. Now shut up.</p>

<p>As I was saying... I thought the name was funny, so I went online to see if the username was already taken. It wasn&rsquo;t. So, in the middle of our recording, I declared that my new username was The Bread Pirate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, the let's play was never published and I didn&rsquo;t have the foresight to save the footage, so we&rsquo;ll just have to go by word of mouth.&nbsp;</p>
