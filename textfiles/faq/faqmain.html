<p style="display:inline-block; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin-top: -1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><em style="display:block; margin-top: 1rem;">(Also known as Frequently Asked Questions.)</em></p>

<details class="accordion">
  <summary class="accordion-btn"><p>Where did the name THE BREAD PIRATE come from?</p></summary>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> It&rsquo;s a reference to the &ldquo;The Dread Pirate Roberts&rdquo; from The Princess Bride.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Answer:</strong> I earned the title for my exploits in the Spanish Main! I plundered so many grain shipments that they dubbed me The Bread Pirate. To this day, I wear it as a badge of honor.</p>

<p><strong>Real Answer:</strong> I became a huge fan of The Princess Bride after my mom forced me to watch it in 2015. From then on I was a Princess Bride apostle. I read the unabridged book twice (it was really hard to find a copy), watched all the behind the scenes footage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1irYUfb-E">made videos about it,</a> and became the biggest Princess Bride fan ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, now fast forward. Pretend we&rsquo;re doing that thing with the VHS Tape where it actually speeds up&hellip;</p>

<img  class="square" src="../faq/images/fastforward.png" alt="VHS fast forward effect." title="VHS go Brrrr!">

<p>In June 2016, me and some friends created a new Terraria world with the intent of making a let's play series (Terraria is a side-scrolling video game and is similar to Minecraft.). We needed usernames and even though I already had a username (Major Burton Wester) I decided to use something different. I went with <em>The Dread Pirate</em> -- the name of the notorious pirate captain from The Princess Bride.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="blue"><em>Hey, you got the name wrong! It&rsquo;s supposed to be Bread, not Dread!&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>What the heck? How did you get into my FAQ?</p>

<p class="blue"><em>Oh, well you left the door unlocked so I thought I&rsquo;d walk in.</em></p>

<p>That was very rude of you. Knock next time.</p>

<p class="blue">Okay... sorry.</p>

<p>Anyways, I typed in the name <em>The Dread Pirate </em>and customized my character. But as I was customizing my character, I noticed a typo. I had used a B instead of a D in the word Dread!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, I accidentally created the name &ldquo;The Bread Pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="blue"><em>See! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you it was supposed to be Bread!</em></p>

<p>Yes. You&rsquo;re very smart. Now shut up.</p>

<p>As I was saying... I thought the name was funny, so I went online to see if the username was already taken. It wasn&rsquo;t. So, in the middle of our recording, I declared that my new username was The Bread Pirate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, the let's play was never published and I didn&rsquo;t have the foresight to save the footage, so we&rsquo;ll just have to go by word of mouth.&nbsp;</p>

  <summary class="accordion-btn">What is your favorite ZELDA GAME?</summary>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>
      My first Zelda game was The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii Version) in 2011. For a long time, it was my favorite Zelda game. But everything changed when I played Link's Crossbow Training.  
    </p>
    <p>Link's Crossbow Training is the pinnacle of gaming. What other Zelda game gives you such a dopamine rush as you lob high speed projectiles at monsters? 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The excitement as your score climbs up. . . 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The 1-to-1 motion controls. . .
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The rush as you 360-no-scope a pot!
<br> &emsp;&emsp;It’s perfect.</p>
<p>And all of this is brought together by the incredible engineering of the Wii Zapper peripheral which makes it feel like you are holding an <em>actual</em> medieval assault rifle.</p> 
<p>Link's Crossbow Training even saved my marriage. For that, I owe it my life. So, Link's Crossbow Training is my favorite Zelda game &nbsp;e v e r.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
<p>I use two computers. The first is a custom built PC whom I call "Inigo Montoya". I first built him in 2017 and he has served me loyally ever since. Then in 2022 when he got worn out, I juiced him up with new parts. So, his technical name is "Inigo Montoya II."</p>
<p>You can find a list of Inigo's PC parts here: <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/TheBreadPirate/saved/#view=NTWspg">LINK TO PC PARTS LIST</a></p>
<p>My second computer is a white laptop that I use while traveling or as a back-up computer when Inigo feels under the weather. Her name is Vivi and she is an ROG Zephyrus G14. It's meant to be a gaming PC, but I mostly use it for editing and coding CSS &amp; HTML (like this website!).</p>
