			Enclave News Network
		</a>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>
		Whew&hellip; this one will take a while to explain. I&rsquo;ll be brief.</p>

        <p>In 2017, I joined the Fallout New Vegas Multiplayer community and had to choose a faction. You could choose from more than a dozen groups, each with their own Discord server and government. I chose The Enclave since I thought they were cool (even though they are technically evil in the lore).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
		Then, after a few weeks I made "Enclave News Network" (ENN) which was a parody of <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave_Radio#:~:text=Enclave%20Radio%20is%20a%20radio,the%20Raven%20Rock%20mountain%20complex.">Enclave Radio</a>. I made videos about Fallout Multiplayer news and propaganda related to The Enclave. Basically it was roleplay! It was a blast but the community died only 5 months after I joined.
        </p>

        <p>
		I honestly should make a video about it someday. The faction system was super unique and I have a lot of stories about it.

    <blockquote>
        <p>This was a collaborative channel made with two friends from high school. We planned to take turns uploading 1 video each week, but I was the only person who uploaded stuff.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> As a joke, we put two typos in the name. "Inquisition" was spelt with a lowercase L at the beginning, and "Llama Bean"s second letter was an uppercase i.</p>
        
        <p>Because the lowercase L and uppercase i are only a pixel different, nobody could tell the difference. (FYI, Do not do that with your username. It makes it a nightmare to search usernames when they have typos. Please, for the love of all things good and holy, don't do it.)</p>
        
        <p>And in case you're curious... yes. I spelled the name like that in this timeline.</p>
