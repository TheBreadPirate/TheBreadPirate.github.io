Allies
</h2>
<h3>Friends of The Bread Pirate and his crew!</h3>


 
<h4 style="color: #ffa6b0; margin-top: .5rem;">Grazzy</h4>
<p>Don't ask about his "Princess Voice."</p> 
<p>Grazzy is best known for his project to rebuild all of Hyrule (BotW) in Minecraft. Since I met him in 2023, we have done numerous videos together on Sealios Spring's channel.</p>
<p>Grazzy often claims, "I am NOT a Zelda YouTuber! I am a Minecraft YouTuber that is stuck with Zelda."</p>

<h4 style="color: #cbf3ff">Sealios Spring</h4>
<p>Equal parts chaotic and genius.</p> 
<p>Sealios Spring is the King of Shorts in the Zelda YouTube Community and is known for being a loose cannon. He also enjoys Minecraft and frequently collaborates with Grazzy on the "Sealios Minecraft Server." He's also from Alaska so his sleep schedule is WACK.</p>
<p>Me, Grazzy, and Sealios all met each other around the same time in 2022. As a result we have become a sitcom trio. (Grazzy the babysitter, Sealios Spring the wild card, and Myself as the third-wheel.)</p>

<h4 style="color: #e4a6ff">Hyrule Gamer</h4>
<p>A steadfast ally of The Bread Pirate.</p> 
<p>Hyrule Gamer (Also known as HG/Adam) hails from the land of the Scots, and is probably the most consistent YouTuber in the entire community. Always uploading at least one video a week; his topics range from "What Would Happen if Link Joined the Yiga Clan" to "What will the Next Zelda Game Be Like." No subject is off limits for Hyrule Gamer.</p>
<p>We did a collaboration about The Legend of Zelda (NES) while my channel was smaller.</p>

<h4 style="color: #91e6ff">Sollus</h4>
<p>Possibly my oldest friend in the Zelda YouTube community!</p> 
<p>When we first met he went by the name of Random_GamerNX and made trick-shot videos about Breath of the Wild. But after a short hiatus he returned to YouTube with the name Sollus. Nowadays he makes challenge run videos (and funny ones at that)!</p>
<p>Sollus is the ONLY Youtuber whom I have edited for. I edited one of his videos while he went by the name Random_GamerNX.</p>

<h4>Zeldom</h4>
<p>Also known as Andy!</p> 
<p>The Texan, "Zeldom" was the first Zelda YouTuber I ever collaborated with. He helped launch my channel to success with our video titled, "What Your Favorite Zelda Game Says About You!" in early 2021.</p>
<p>He doesn't make videos as often as he used too due to his job but we still collaborate every year!</p>


<h4 style="color: #f5ac38; ">Zeltik</h4>
<p>The enigmatic "King" of the Zelda Community.</p> 
<p>Ed "King" or Zeltik, as he is known, is the largest and most regular YouTuber in the Zelda community. But, he is also infamous for how difficult it is to contact him (this is because his channel is so large). In many ways, he is like a mysterious wizard tucked away in the hills. And the only time he can be summoned is during times of crisis. M Y S T E R I O U S !</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Zeltik for an interview in 2021. He's a really chill dude, but be apparently has no idea why his channel got so big. My guess for why he's the best: the accent.</p>

<h4 style="color: #0069d1; -webkit-text-stroke: .03rem #ffffff; text-shadow: .1rem .08rem .05rem rgba(132, 132, 132, 0.9);">Moderators</h4>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention the wonderful shipmates on the Discord server!</p>
<ul style="margin-top: -1rem;">
<li>YoshiRuns (Speedrunning extraordinaire!)</li>
<li>Lior (Coding Wizard and Level-Headed Leader)</li>
<li>Clover (Down to earth and personable!)</li>
<li>Cardboard (Vigilant and good at spotting trouble)</li>
<li>The Tax Pirate (Obsessed with anime and guns. What could go wrong!)</li>
<li>And some other's whom I will add later...</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color: #f5ac38">SuperZeldaGirl</h4>
<p>The crafty let's player!</p> 
<p>SuperZeldaGirl is a YouTuber who does TONS of Lets Plays about the Zelda series (and dabbles with the horror genre). She is reknown for her cosplaying skills, her love of Ganondorf, and being the #1 Defender of Tingle.</p>
<p>I talk with her quite often, and we even created a team for the Triforce Trends Gameshow in 2022.</p>
