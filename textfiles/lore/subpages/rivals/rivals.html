Rivals
</h2>
<h3>People who wish to challenge The Bread Pirate! (Or vise versa!)</h3>



 
<h4 style="color: #42f500">Nayru</h4>
<p>Public enemy #1.</p> 
<p>Nayru is a Canadian/Subrosian YouTuber who publishes intricate theories about the Zelda Lore. He is the greatest debater in the community and is NOT to be taken lightly. His wit and sarcasm know no bounds.</p>
<p>Me and Nayru became rivals during the Christmas of 2020. This is how it happened: In the hours leading up to Christmas a small man in a green hood stole ALL the bread in my house. I barely saw them as they slinked out the back door. But, thanks to my superior Zelda knowledge I knew the culprit matched the appearance of a Subrosian! So, I confronted my neighbor, Nayru, about the issue. He swore he had nothing to do with it, but I saw through his lies.</p>
<p>In retaliation, me and my crew kidnapped his Subrosian girlfriend. But Nayru used dark magic to free her ("Dark Magic" is code for "I have no idea how he managed to do that.")</p>
<p>To this day we have been arch-rivals.</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Nayru</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>His favorite game is Wind Waker.</li>
<li>He was a history major in college.</li>
<li>He has finished Ocarina of Time over 35 times.</li>
<li>Nayru prefers the older 3D games over Breath of the Wild + Tears of the Kingdom.</li>
<li>Knows Martial Arts</li>
</ul>
<p>(He also hates The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. What kind of sick person hates TWILIGHT PRINCESS?!)</p>



<h4 style="color: #f58400">Foxes</h4>
<p>Yes, all foxes.</p> 
<p>On March 14th 2023, my YouTube channel was hacked! For 12 hours, the hackers turned my channel into a "FOX News Livestream" to sell cryptocurrency. Thankfully I recovered my channel (shout out to the YouTube Team!), but the culprit was still at large. And by that I mean THE FOXES!</p>
<p>Who else is devious enough to execute such a malicious plot. Clearly, the entire species of 'canis vulpes' is conspiring against me.</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Foxes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sneaky!</li>
<li>They eat small rodents and birds.</li>
<li>They like to hide in tall grass.</li>
<li>Foxes are weak to high-speed nuclear warheads.</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="color: #ffffff">RinHara5aki</h4>
<p>The combat wizard.</p> 
<p>Rin (whose name is pronounced as "Rin-hara-saki) is a Zelda Combat expert that works as a GameSpot journalist.</p>
<p>Me and Rin both make Zelda Fact Videos and this caused us to step on each other's toes. Especially since neither of us wanted to be seen as a "copy-cat" of the other's channel. However, overtime this issue has subsided as we came to an agreement over who can cover which facts.</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Rin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Created the Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom Combat Glossary, a giant document with hundreds of tutorials for the community to learn from.</li>
<li>Is EXTREMELY dangerous in combat.</li>
<li>Currently has no known weakness.</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="color: #fd8282">Bark &amp; Bite</h4>
<p>The two numskull Bokoblins.</p> 
<p>These two bokoblins have been a thorn in my side ever since I met them in 2019.</p>
<p>Bark is the brains of the operation, and Bite is the muscle who protects the brains. They seem to be best friends (or brothers?) yet Bark constantly calls Bite and idiot.</p>
<p>Originally, they were just two normal bokoblins whom I asked to feature in a film. In return I promised to pay them in meat and fruits, but after I stopped bribing them Bark got mad and began to derail my channel.</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Bark</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely eloquent by Bokoblin standards.</li>
<li>Hates his boss.</li>
<li>Is lazy. I rarely see him do work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes On Bite</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adept with bows and clubs!</li>
<li>Will do anything Bark tells him to do.</li>
<li>Dislikes thinking. He finds it exhausting.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color: #c4c1be">Curtomatic</h4>
<p>An upstart YouTuber who DARED to challenge me in a contest.</p> 
<p>Curt publishes challenge videos for the Zelda series, such as his popular "No Jump Challenge." But in December of 2023 he challenged me to a Bingo-Lockout Challenge to see who was the better Tears of the Kingdom player.</p>
<p>Ever since, me and Curt have held a brutal rivalry.</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Curtomatic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deceptive</li>
<li>Witty</li>
<li>Preys on fear.</li>
<li>Is weak to Frox Monster.</li>
</ul>
